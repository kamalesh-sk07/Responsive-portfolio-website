DESCRIPTION:# THE RESPONSIVE PORTFOLIO WEBSITE WITH TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES
The Responsive Portfolio Website is a personal web-based project developed as part of the Snestron Internship task to showcase web development skills using modern front-end technologies. This website acts as a digital portfolio that introduces who I am, highlights my skills, and displays my completed projects. The goal is to create a fully functional, responsive, and visually appealing portfolio that works seamlessly across devices including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

The project was built using the following technologies and tools:


---

üõ† Tools & Technologies Used:

HTML5: Used to build the structure of the website. All the elements such as headings, sections, links, and paragraphs were created using semantic HTML.

CSS3: Used for styling the website. CSS enabled layout control, colors, fonts, spacing, and responsiveness using Flexbox and media queries.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): Used for adding interactivity (e.g., menu toggle in mobile view and console logs).

VS Code: The entire project was coded using Visual Studio Code, which provided an efficient development environment with extensions like Live Server, Prettier, and Emmet.

Git: Git was used for version control, allowing smooth tracking of code changes throughout the development process.

GitHub: The final project was pushed to a public GitHub repository. This also helped in sharing the project link for internship evaluation.

üß± Project Features:

Home Page with Name and Navigation

About Me Section: Includes a brief introduction about me, my interests, and development goals.

Projects Section: Describes the portfolio website and other projects with their purposes and outcomes.

Contact Section: Includes contact details such as email and GitHub links.

Footer Section: Contains copyright and developer credit.

üìê Design Approach:

The design is minimalistic and clean with a focus on content and readability. The color scheme includes white backgrounds with green accents to keep the interface soothing and professional. The layout uses Flexbox for alignment and responsiveness. The navigation bar adapts to different screen sizes, and sections are stacked vertically for mobile views.

All HTML elements are well-commented and organized into semantic sections. CSS classes are named consistently for easier maintenance. The website follows mobile-first design principles, ensuring optimal performance on smaller screens.


This portfolio website represents my commitment to becoming a skilled front-end developer. It not only fulfills the internship task requirements but also acts as a foundation for future projects and job opportunities. I plan to extend it by adding more projects, a downloadable resume, a blog section, and dynamic content using JavaScript frameworks in the future.
